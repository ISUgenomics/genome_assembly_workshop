### Genome Assembly Workshop:

This interactive workshop is filled with tips and tricks for Genome Assembly. All researchers and students with command line and HPC experience are welcome to come and explore the assumptions and limitations of a genome assembly in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

In this workshop, we will cover the following topics:

* Assembly Fundamentals: Understand the assumptions and limitations in genome assembly due to biology, sequencing technology and assembly tools. 
* Hands-On Coding: Complete a genome assembly from start to finish: quality control, assembly, scaffolding and polishing.
* Evaluation of Assemblies: Not all genomes are equal! Gain the expertise to critically assess the quality of a genome assembly.
