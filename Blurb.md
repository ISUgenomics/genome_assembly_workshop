### Genome Assembly Workshop:

Welcome to an interactive workshop covering the nitty gritty of Genome Assembly. We welcome researchers and students to come and explore both the scientific theories and techniques of a genome assembly in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

In this workshop, we will delve into:

* Scientific Fundamentals: Understand the essential concepts that drive both wet lab procedures and computational strategies in genome assembly.
* Hands-On Coding: Experience real-world application through coding sessions where you'll learn to use cutting-edge genome assembly software.
* Evaluation of Assemblies: Gain the expertise to critically assess the outcomes of genome assembly projects.
